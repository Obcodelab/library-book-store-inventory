# Library and Book Store Inventory System ðŸ“š

## Overview

The **Library and Book Store Inventory System** is a web application designed to manage the tracking, cataloging, and circulation of books in a library or bookstore. It includes inventory control, lending (borrowing and purchasing), and sales management features. This system is built using **Django** for the backend and **Django Rest Framework** for the API.

### Features:

- **Book Cataloging**: Allows for easy tracking of books in the library or bookstore.
- **Inventory Management**: Keeps track of available, borrowed, and purchased books.
- **Lending System**: Enables users to borrow and return books with due dates and late fees.
